Hi,
my name is Guillermo and I am a programmer specializing in C++ with a particular focus on numerical modeling. 
My expertise lies in developing and optimizing algorithms that simulate complex phenomena, 
enabling precise and efficient solutions in fields such as engineering, physics, and applied mathematics. 
I am passionate about tackling challenges that require logical thinking and 
the application of advanced programming techniques to solve numerical problems and computational simulations. 
I am always seeking new opportunities to apply my knowledge and continue learning in this fascinating field.
